            <h1>Plate Boundaries Overview</h1>
            <p>Tectonic plates are massive pieces of Earth's lithosphere that fit together like a puzzle, covering the Earth's surface. The movement of these plates shape the planet's surface. There are three main types of plate boundaries: convergent, divergent, and transform.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="convergent">
            <h2>Convergent Boundaries</h2>
            <p>Convergent boundaries occur where two plates move towards each other. There are three types: oceanic-continental, oceanic-oceanic, and continental-continental.</p>
            <h3>Examples of Convergent Boundaries</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Himalayas:</strong> Formed by the collision of the Indian Plate and the European Plate (continental-continental).</li>
                <li><strong>The Andes:</strong> Formed by the moving of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate (oceanic-continental).</li>
                <li><strong>The Mariana Trench:</strong> Formed by the moving of the Pacific Plate beneath the Mariana Plate (oceanic-oceanic).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How Convergent Boundaries Work</h3>
            <p>At convergent boundaries, plates move towards each other, leading to the moving of one plate beneath the other or the collision and damaging of the plates. This process is also known as subduction, and it forms mountain ranges and volcanoes.</p>

        <section id="divergent">
            <h2>Divergent Boundaries</h2>
            <p>Divergent boundaries occur where two plates move away from each other. </p>
            <h3>Examples of Divergent Boundaries</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Mid-Atlantic Ridge:</strong> A divergent boundary between the European Plate and the North American Plate.</li>
                <li><strong>The East African Rift:</strong> A divergent boundary between the African plate and the Somali plate.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How Divergent Boundaries Work</h3>
            <p>At divergent boundaries, plates move apart, allowing magma to rise and create new crust. This process can form different things, including mid-ocean ridges, rift valleys, and volcanic activity.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="transform">
            <h2>Transform Boundaries</h2>
            <p>Transform boundaries occur where two plates slide past each other horizontally. </p>
            <h3>Examples of Transform Boundaries</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The San Andreas Fault:</strong> A transform boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate.</li>
                <li><strong>The Alpine Fault:</strong> A transform boundary in New Zealand between the Pacific Plate and the Indo-Australian Plate.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How Transform Boundaries Work</h3>
            <p>At transform boundaries, plates slide past each other horizontally, causing friction to build up until it is released as an earthquake. Transform boundaries are different from convergent and divergent boundaries because there is no vertical movement, so volcanic activity is not associated with them.</p>
