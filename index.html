            <h1>Plate Boundaries Overview</h1>
            <p>Tectonic plates are massive slabs of Earth's lithosphere that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, covering the Earth's surface. The movement and interaction of these plates shape the planet's surface and lead to various geological phenomena. There are three main types of plate boundaries: convergent, divergent, and transform.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="convergent">
            <h2>Convergent Boundaries</h2>
            <p>Convergent boundaries occur where two plates move towards each other. There are three subtypes: oceanic-continental, oceanic-oceanic, and continental-continental.</p>
            <h3>Examples of Convergent Boundaries</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Himalayas:</strong> Formed by the collision of the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate (continental-continental).</li>
                <li><strong>The Andes:</strong> Formed by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate (oceanic-continental).</li>
                <li><strong>The Mariana Trench:</strong> Formed by the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the Mariana Plate (oceanic-oceanic).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How Convergent Boundaries Work</h3>
            <p>At convergent boundaries, plates move towards each other, leading to the subduction of one plate beneath the other or the collision and crumpling of the plates. This process forms subduction zones, mountain ranges, and volcanic activity.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="divergent">
            <h2>Divergent Boundaries</h2>
            <p>Divergent boundaries occur where two plates move away from each other. This process leads to the formation of new crust as magma rises to the surface.</p>
            <h3>Examples of Divergent Boundaries</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Mid-Atlantic Ridge:</strong> A divergent boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the North American Plate.</li>
                <li><strong>The East African Rift:</strong> A divergent boundary between the African Plate and the Somali Plate.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How Divergent Boundaries Work</h3>
            <p>At divergent boundaries, plates move apart, allowing magma to rise and create new crust. This process forms mid-ocean ridges, rift valleys, and volcanic activity.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="transform">
            <h2>Transform Boundaries</h2>
            <p>Transform boundaries occur where two plates slide past each other horizontally. This movement leads to the formation of strike-slip faults and significant earthquake activity.</p>
            <h3>Examples of Transform Boundaries</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The San Andreas Fault:</strong> A transform boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate.</li>
                <li><strong>The Alpine Fault:</strong> A transform boundary in New Zealand between the Pacific Plate and the Indo-Australian Plate.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How Transform Boundaries Work</h3>
            <p>At transform boundaries, plates slide past each other horizontally, causing friction and stress to build up until it is released as an earthquake. Unlike convergent and divergent boundaries, there is no significant vertical movement, so volcanic activity is not associated with transform boundaries.</p>
